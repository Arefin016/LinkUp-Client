      </h2>
      <p className="mt-10 items-center text-2xl justify-between text-justify font-medium">
        Easy Scheduling
      </p>
      <p className="mt-5 items-center justify-between text-justify">
        LinkUp offers a streamlined and simplified meeting booking process that
        allows users to schedule meetings with just a few clicks. Whether you're
        booking a one-on-one session or organizing a group meeting, our
        intuitive interface makes it easy to find available time slots, invite
        participants, and confirm your booking—all within minutes. No more
        back-and-forth emails or confusing coordination—just a quick and
        effortless scheduling experience.

      <p className="mt-10 items-center text-2xl justify-between text-justify font-medium">
        Calendar Integration
      </p>
      <p className="mt-5 items-center justify-between text-justify">
        Stay organized by syncing your meetings directly with your preferred
        calendar. LinkUp integrates seamlessly with popular calendar platforms
        such as Google Calendar, Outlook, and iCal. This means that once a
        meeting is booked, it will automatically appear in your personal or work
        calendar, helping you avoid double bookings or missed appointments.
        Whether you're on the go or at your desk, your schedule is always in
        sync.

        Notifications & Reminders
      </p>
      <p className="mt-5 items-center justify-between text-justify">
        Never miss a meeting again with LinkUp’s built-in notifications and
        reminders. As soon as you confirm a booking, you’ll receive a
        confirmation email, and closer to the meeting time, you’ll get reminders
        to ensure you're prepared. Whether it’s a 24-hour reminder or a
        last-minute alert, LinkUp keeps you informed and on time, helping you
        stay organized and punctual.

        User Dashboard
      </p>
      <p className="mt-5 items-center justify-between text-justify">
        The user-friendly dashboard on LinkUp serves as a centralized hub for
        managing all your meetings in one place. From here, you can view your
        upcoming meetings, reschedule or cancel existing bookings, and keep
        track of meeting details such as attendees and agenda items. The
        dashboard is designed to make managing multiple appointments simple and
        hassle-free, so you stay in control of your time.

      <p className="mt-5 items-center justify-between text-justify">
        LinkUp is fully optimized for use across a variety of devices, ensuring
        a seamless experience whether you’re accessing the platform on a
        desktop, tablet, or mobile phone. Our responsive design adapts to

        from anywhere, at any time. This flexibility ensures that you're always
