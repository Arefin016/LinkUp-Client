        Scheduling can often feel overwhelming, but with the right strategies, you can make the process more efficient and effective.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">1. Set Clear Goals</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Start by defining what you want to achieve with your meetings. Are you aiming for collaboration, decision-making, or updates? Clear goals help you schedule the right meetings with the right people.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">2. Use Scheduling Tools</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Tools like LinkUp can help streamline the scheduling process by allowing users to see available time slots and book appointments easily.

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">3. Block Time for Deep Work</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Ensure you allocate time in your schedule for focused work. Avoid scheduling back-to-back meetings, as this can lead to burnout.

      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">

      </p>
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">5. Follow Up</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        After meetings, send follow-ups to summarize discussions and action items. This helps keep everyone accountable and on track.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        By implementing these tips, you can take control of your scheduling and make the most out of every meeting.
